The purpose of this project is to showcase what I have learned about design, layout, HTML, CSS, and some JavaScript.

## Description

Community Science Museum is a project brief detailing the concept of a science museum focused on showing and teaching science in an interesting, fun and interactive way. The target audience is mainly everyone interested in learning about our world and discoveries, but some of their showcases are especially targeted at teaching children.

The project description specified to add at least 4 pages. I decided to add the following pages:

- Home
- About
- Visit
- Exhibitions
- Events
- Explore
- Get Involved
- News

## Built With

I built this website using the following coding languages and APIs:

- HTML
